# My first plugin with many QOL features 
*well for now it's in early dev phase so it has little to offer :v but you can track my progress*

## [Download KiraEssentialz](https://github.com/Kir4R00t/KiraEssentialz/raw/master/target/KiraEssentialz-1.0.jar) // this is not working for now
- To make it work just download the plugin.jar file (download link above) and put it in your ~/plugins folder
## Features:
- **/show** --> allows you to show off your cool enchanted sword to everyone without having to give it to anyone
- **/sethome** --> set your "home" to which you can teleport at any moment (/home to tp & /clearhome to clear saved location)
- **/lastdeath** --> check coordinates of your last death
